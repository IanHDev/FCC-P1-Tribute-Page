      <li>He has since been mentored by some of the most experienced and innovative lipidologists, endocrinologists, gynecologists, sleep physiologists, and longevity scientists in the United States and Canada.
      <li>Peter earned his M.D. from Stanford University and holds a B.Sc. in mechanical engineering and applied mathematics. He is licensed in Texas (S8803), California (A96452), and New York (281406-1).
      <li>Peter also hosts The Drive, a weekly, ultra-deep-dive podcast focusing on maximizing health, longevity, critical thinking, and a few other things.

    "When you stop caring about being right in the eyes of everyone—versus being right in your own eyes and the eyes of those who matter to you—it’s amazing how little you care to waste energy trying to convince people of your view."
